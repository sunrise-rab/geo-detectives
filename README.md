#  Geo Detectives
Geo Detectives is a child-friendly geography quiz where players test their world knowledge by answering timed questions about countries, capitals, and landmarks.  
Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the project uses the Open Trivia Database API to generate fun, educational challenges for children aged 7–12.
