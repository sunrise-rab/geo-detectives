#  Geo Detectives
Geo Detectives is a child-friendly geography quiz where players test their world knowledge by answering timed questions about countries, capitals, and landmarks.  
Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the project uses the Open Trivia Database API to generate fun, educational challenges for children aged 7â€“12.

## Rationale
Geo Detectives was created to make geography learning interactive and exciting for children.  
It extends the ideas of my previous project, Bond, by combining creativity, curiosity, and education through gameplay.
