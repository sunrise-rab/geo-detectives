#  Geo Detectives
Geo Detectives is a child-friendly geography quiz where players test their world knowledge by answering timed questions about countries, capitals, and landmarks.  
Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the project uses the Open Trivia Database API to generate fun, educational challenges for children aged 7–12.

## Wirefrmes
Before starting the development of Geo Detectives, I created detailed wireframes using [Balsamiq Wireframes](https://balsamiq.com/) to plan the structure and layout of the website.
These visual mockups helped me organise each section — from the home screen and quiz layout to the results and feedback screens — ensuring a simple and child-friendly experience across all devices.

## Design Choices
### Typography

To keep the design fun yet readable for children, I used [Google font](https://fonts.google.com/selection) and I selected two Google Fonts that balance playfulness and clarity:
 - Gloria Hallelujah (used for headings and quiz titles).
This handwritten font adds a creative, adventurous tone that feels inviting to younger users. It captures the personality of a child’s travel notebook or explorer’s journal, which fits the Geo Detectives theme.

- Poppins (used for body text, buttons, and feedback messages).
A clean, modern sans-serif that ensures easy readability across devices and screen sizes. Its round, friendly letter shapes make it visually compatible with Gloria Hallelujah.

### Colour Palette

The Geo Detectives colour scheme is inspired by map background image, I used [Coloors Image Picker](https://coolors.co/image-picker). This tool helped me combines warm earthy tones with bright highlights to create a balanced, child-friendly interface.

I have also used [Contrast Grid](https://contrastgrid.com/?xAxisData=%255B%257B%2522color%2522%253A%2522%252334190D%2522%257D%252C%257B%2522color%2522%253A%2522%2523D6CDB9%2522%257D%252C%257B%2522color%2522%253A%2522%2523C5B29A%2522%257D%252C%257B%2522color%2522%253A%2522%2523B4977A%2522%257D%252C%257B%2522color%2522%253A%2522%2523BEB0A8%2522%257D%252C%257B%2522color%2522%253A%2522%2523604A3A%2522%257D%255D) to get inspiration for possible colour combination to make the website visually appealing.
