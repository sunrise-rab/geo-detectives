#  Geo Detectives
Geo Detectives is a child-friendly geography quiz where players test their world knowledge by answering timed questions about countries, capitals, and landmarks.  
Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the project uses the Open Trivia Database API to generate fun, educational challenges for children aged 7–12.

## Wirefrmes
Before starting the development of Geo Detectives, I created detailed wireframes using [Balsamiq Wireframes](https://balsamiq.com/) to plan the structure and layout of the website.
These visual mockups helped me organise each section — from the home screen and quiz layout to the results and feedback screens — ensuring a simple and child-friendly experience across all devices.
